# US-Household-Income-Analysis


The "US Household Income Analysis" project is an in-depth exploration of various factors influencing household income in the United States. This study encompasses a range of variables such as geographical location (country, place, state), loan information, water accessibility, and additional relevant parameters.

By scrutinizing these diverse elements, the project aims to uncover patterns and trends that contribute to variances in household income across different regions and demographics. Analyzing the impact of location, loan status, water availability, and other pertinent factors on household income can provide valuable insights into the economic landscape of the United States.
